        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>We all accrue wounding in the course of living. Finding the right therapist is the best way to find help to heal wounds. To support those who seek change, Nicola Counseling Services clinicians take an authentic, non-judgmental approach that is free of trend-driven techniques. By providing a safe and respectful space that values and nourishes the healing process, clients can expect non-pathologized care. Given that conflict comes in many forms, our therapeutic approach is equally personalized. We work well with people who appreciate a confidential and integrative approach that is pragmatic and tailored to unique experiences. We assist individuals who seek to learn new coping strategies and heal emotional bonds in order to feel safe, secure, and connected. We partner with clients who want to make positive changes in their lives. We are not in-network providers, but will work with your out-of-network benefits. This is the best way we can protect your privacy. Those without insurance or reimbursement can expect a reduced fee. We believe therapy works best when a high standard of confidentiality is met.

    <p>The Lived Experience Project with Widian Nicola is a podcast show that explores unique and evocative narratives rarely heard in mainstream media. Each season focuses on a lesser known and marginalized population and how these oral histories unveil the often complex nature of the shared human condition. Through this, we hope to build communities infused with awareness and compassion.</p>
